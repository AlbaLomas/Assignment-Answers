Hi!

If you want to see the final output of the scripts in the terminal screen you have to run the main.rb file.
If you want to create an output file (report.txt) with the final output of the scripts you have to run the report.rb file.
In the terminal, you have to write: 
                ruby main.rb/report.rb ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt threshold(a number between 0.485 and 0.6)
